Are you a Front-end Developer, that wants to learn and grow but have a mental block when it comes to inspiration? Inspiration is all around us, yet sometimes we are blind to something that is right in front us. Social media platforms are great for inspiration and here's why.

# Twitter

Twitter is a great platform for learning a variety of Front-End topics, whether it's JavaScript, CSS, HTML, new libraries or frameworks and much more.

- People
  - Fellow Front-end developers regularly tweet about useful code snippets, libraries and motivational techniques. There are loads of questions, polls and general tech conversations. There is a vast experience of knowledge from a range of backgrounds.
  - '#100DaysOfCode' and '#100DaysOfCSS' is a really good hashtag to follow to either learn or to help others.
  - Often you find inspiration in CodePens built by others, which will spark your motivation to build your own.
- Companies
  - While you may be hesitant to follow companies, they are often also great for posting tips and techniques to learn from.
  - Companies often post about latest technology trends so if you want to stay up-to-date for the future, be sure to follow some.
- Lists
  - Twitter allows you to collate a group of accounts or subscribe to other lists. You can then view the timeline of tweets based on those accounts.

## Pinterest

Pinterest is great for getting UI/UX inspiration, often you don't want to click on the pins that take you to blog sites as that's what a search engine is for but here are some ways that I personally use Pinterest for.

By setting up a Front-end board, you can pin some of the following:

- Website design
  - Great for if you want to practice your development skills and create copycat websites. Copycat websites are for practice only and you must not claim ownership of them, think of them like a coding challenge to try and re-create for personal use.
- HTML elements
  - By searching for different HTML elements like radio buttons, buttons, search inputs etc. You can get a vast variety of styles, try re-creating some and adding your own personal styles to it.
- Infographics
  - Need help choosing a framework, Pinterest is great for Infographics and seeing an overview of options for your specific topic. By viewing what options are available, you can then dive deeper into specifics.
- General images
  - Often by scrolling through images such as tattoos, landscapes, animals etc. Inspiration is right in front of you, why not try recreating your own version of the image in CSS as an illustration or cartoon.
